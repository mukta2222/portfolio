    <h2>Mukta Rai – Project Architect</h2>
    <p>
      As the <span class="highlight">Project Architect</span> leading this initiative under my independent practice, I was responsible for the end-to-end architectural design and execution of <strong>Harihar Hospital, Mandi</strong>—a critical healthcare infrastructure project envisioned to improve medical access in the remote and hilly regions of Himachal Pradesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Situated in a seismically sensitive, mountainous terrain with extreme seasonal variations, the hospital posed significant design challenges related to site integration, climate resilience, and operational functionality. I led the project from conceptualization through construction, delivering a facility that is not only clinically efficient but also contextually grounded, environmentally responsive, and human-centered.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Contributions & Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Architectural Vision & Design Leadership</span><br>
        Conceived and developed the architectural concept with a strong emphasis on healing environments, patient dignity, and operational efficiency. Designed a terraced layout that follows the natural slope of the site, minimizing excavation, preserving existing vegetation, and offering panoramic views to patient rooms to support psychological well-being.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Site-Responsive Planning</span><br>
        Responded to the steep topography through a stepped, gravity-fed zoning strategy—organizing public, clinical, inpatient, and service blocks across interconnected levels. This ensured intuitive circulation, reduced mechanical dependency, and seamless vertical connectivity via elevators and ramps compliant with accessibility standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Climate-Adaptive Design</span><br>
        Integrated passive design strategies tailored to the cold mountain climate:
        <ul style="margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>High-performance insulated envelopes with double-glazed windows</li>
          <li>South-facing solariums and sunrooms for passive solar heating</li>
          <li>Cross-ventilation corridors and operable windows for summer cooling</li>
          <li>Overhangs and windbreaks to shield against cold northern winds</li>
        </ul>
        These strategies significantly reduced energy consumption and enhanced indoor thermal comfort.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Functional & Regulatory Compliance</span><br>
        Developed detailed architectural drawings and technical specifications in alignment with:
        <ul style="margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>National Building Code (NBC) of India</li>
          <li>CPWD Hospital Design Guidelines</li>
          <li>NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals) standards</li>
          <li>Disability Rights Act (2016) for universal accessibility</li>
          <li>Himachal Pradesh Hill Area Development Regulations</li>
        </ul>
        Ensured optimal room sizes, clear circulation paths, infection control layouts, and emergency egress throughout.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Sustainable Systems Integration</span><br>
        Designed and implemented eco-sensitive solutions including:
        <ul style="margin-top: 8px;">
          <li>Rainwater harvesting system with 150,000-liter underground storage</li>
          <li>On-site STP (Sewage Treatment Plant) for reuse in landscaping</li>
          <li>Rooftop solar water heating and 50 kW solar PV system</li>
          <li>Use of locally sourced stone, timber, and low-carbon materials to reduce embodied energy</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Construction Supervision & Quality Control</span><br>
        Conducted regular site visits throughout the construction phase, overseeing workmanship, material selection, and adherence to design intent. Resolved on-site challenges related to logistics, structural detailing, and MEP coordination in a remote location with limited skilled labor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Multidisciplinary Coordination</span><br>
        Led coordination between structural, MEP, medical gas, fire safety, and landscape consultants. Collaborated with medical planners to ensure clinical workflows—especially in ICU, OT, and emergency departments—met functional and safety benchmarks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlight">Team Leadership & Project Management</span><br>
        Mentored a small core team of architects and drafters, managing timelines, deliverables, and client communication. Successfully delivered the project within budget and schedule, despite logistical delays due to weather and terrain.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="conclusion">
      Harihar Hospital has become a vital healthcare hub for Mandi and surrounding districts, offering round-the-clock emergency care, maternal health services, diagnostics, and specialist consultations. The design has been praised for its harmony with the landscape, climatic intelligence, and patient-centric planning.
      <br><br>
      As an independently led project, this endeavor reflects my deep commitment to responsible architecture in challenging contexts—where design must respond not only to functional needs but also to geography, climate, and community.
